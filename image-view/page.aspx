                <h3>INTRODUCTION</h3>
                &emsp;&emsp;Finding the Jivas in acute distress and delusion, and that they have deviated considerably
                from true Parmarth
                and are totally incapable of releasing themselves from the bondages of birth and death, the
                Supreme Being Radhasoami Dayal was moved with immense compassion. He incarnated Himself in
                this world in 1818 as Sant Sat Guru, in the form of Param Purush Puran Dhani Soamiji Maharaj
                and revealed an easy and simple path for the salvation of Jivas.
                <br /> &emsp;&emsp;RADHA is the name of the Dhun (reverberation) and SOAMI is the Shabd (sound).
                Know that Dhun and Shabd are one and the same, like water and its wave. Make no distinction
                between the two. RADHA is the lover and SOAMI, the beloved. RADHASOAMI sings of the union
                of Surat and Shabd. RADHA is the Name of the Adi (primal) Surat and SOAMI is the Adi Shabd.
                RADHA and SOAMI form an inseparable pair like Surat and Shabd. Know that both Radha and Soami
                are one word RADHASOAMI. As Surat dallies with Shabd, so does RADHA abide in close union
                with SOAMI.
                <br /> &emsp;&emsp;
                <b>"Radhasoami"</b> is the true and real name of the Supreme Creator. The goal of the Radhasoami
                Faith is the only true goal; of true and perfect salvation which can be attained only by
                practising Surat Shabd Yoga (union of spirit with sound current). As per Radhasoami Faith,
                the entire creation is divided into three divisions.
                <ul>
                    <li>
                        <b>Spiritual:</b> The First or the Highest Division is called Sat Desh or Dayal Desh
                        (region) where pure spirit, uncontaminated by mind and matter, exists. It is comprised
                        of six sub-divisions.</li>
                    <li>
                        <b>Spiritual-material:</b> The Second Division is called the Brahm Desh or Brahmand
                        where highest and pure form of mind and subtle matter exist with spirit; the latter
                        predominates. It is also comprised of six sub-divisions.</li>
                    <li>
                        <b>Material-spiritual:</b> The Third Division is called Jiva Desh or Ichchha Desh or
                        Pind Desh or simply Pind where matter is coarse and impure, and spirit is feeble
                        and to a certain extent under the control of the forces of mind and matter. It is also comprised
                        of six sub-divisions. </li>
                </ul>
                &emsp;&emsp;The above three grand divisions of the universe have a correspondence, or are on the same
                plane, with similar
                divisions in the human body, which is a miniature (microcosm) of the universe (macrocosm).
                The deliverance of spirit from the bondage of mind and matter, i.e., the body and senses,
                and its gradual ascension and eventual entrance into the First or Highest Division, by the
                practice of Surat Shabd Yoga, is perfect salvation. The seat of the spirit in the human body
                is at the top of material-spiritual division (Pind). The Supreme Father, Radhasoami Dayal,
                is a boundless ocean of spirit, love and bliss. The spirit entity is a drop from this ocean
                or a ray of the Supreme Sun and in essence is the same as the Supreme Father. Having descended
                from the Highest or First Region, the Surat (spirit) has, in its present state, become encased
                in material coverings and, in a manner, intermingled with matter and is, in the Third Region,
                subject to the forces resulting from such mixture. It has thereby lost its innate powers
                of discrimination and intelligence, and has become subject to carnal desires and passions.
                As long as it remains in the Second and Third Divisions where mind and matter exist, it cannot
                be freed from future births in the lower or higher regions. It is only in the First or the
                Highest Division where mind and matter do not exist that there is no re-birth. There is an
                everlasting conscious state of love and bliss. Radhasoami Faith is not based on the scriptures
                appertaining to any religion but on the precepts or sayings of the Sant Sat Gurus. The holy
                name "Radhasoami" is not identical with any other name. Radhasoami Faith consists of four
                essentials:
                <ul>
                    <li>
                        <b>Sant Sat Guru:</b> The personification of the Supreme Being. Sant Sat Guru or Sat
                        Guru is He who has either descended directly from the Highest Division or reached
                        that region by the practice of Surat Shabd Yoga under the immediate direction of
                        the former and has become one with Him. </li>
                    <li>
                        <b>Sat Shabd:</b> The sound proceeding from the original source, i.e., Sat Desh. It
                        undergoes some change, or in other words, is enveloped in coverings at every step
                        in its descent.</li>
                    <li>
                        <b>Satsang:</b> As without Sant Sat Guru there can be no Satsang, the word "Satsang"
                        always connotes, to a votary, association of Sant Sat Guru who is the central pivot
                        on which the entire Faith hinges. Satsang can also be held in the company of loving
                        devotees. This is outward or external Satsang. Internal Satsang is the company of
                        spiritual current within. It consists in listening to the spiritual sounds internally.</li>
                    <li>
                        <b>Sat Anurag:</b> Also known as true love or Prem. Radhasoami Faith consists only in
                        cultivating an affection, or rather an intense love, for the Sant Sat Guru. The relation
                        between the Sant Sat Guru and the Satsangi or devotee is purely of spirit or holy
                        love, love to begin with, love to go on with and love to end with, the purity and
                        intensity of love varying, of course, with the progress a devotee makes in his journey
                        on the inward and upward path.</li>
                </ul>
                &emsp;&emsp;Public preaching or propaganda is neither recognized nor allowed in the Radhasoami Faith.
                The two important doctrines of Sant Mat are (i) Firstly, that Sants generally
                do not interfere with the well-defined laws of eradication of Karams of Jivas, except in
                rare and specially deserving cases, (ii) Secondly, Sants do not make their advent here for
                the fulfilment of worldly desires of Jivas. The practice of Radhasoami Faith (Surat Shabd
                Abhyas) can be performed in the human frame alone. As such it is also necessary to maintain
                the human body.

                                        <h4>TENETS</h4>
                                        The doctrines and tenets of the Faith, as originally propounded, are contained in the writings and discourses of its August
                                        Founder, Soamiji Maharaj, and the succeeding Sant Sat Gurus.
                                        <ul>
                                            <li>The only conditions required for embracing the Faith are abstinence from animal food
                                                and intoxicants.</li>
                                            <li>Compliance with the moral and ethical principles of conduct as understood and practised
                                                in a civilized society. </li>
                                            <li>Radhasoami Faith does not require or permit any one to quit one's family or to give up
                                                one's avocation or profession. One has to live in the world and at the same time
                                                remain detached from it, like a lotus in water without getting wet.</li>
                                            <li>A follower should, as far as possible, gradually curb and restrain his downward tendencies
                                                by detaching himself from material objects.</li>
                                            <li>The devotee should earn his living by Haq and Halal (right and honest means), i.e., by
                                                hard work. Even a tinge of greed or dishonesty in acquiring wealth results in grave
                                                injury to his spiritual progress.</li>
                                            <li>`Kusang' (bad company) should always be avoided. Every company except that of Sant Sat
                                                Guru and His devotees is more or less `Kusang'. It is a different matter if a devotee
                                                has to associate with the Sansaris (worldly) people in the course of his duties or
                                                avocation, which he has adopted to earn a living; but he should have no liking for
                                                or take pleasure in their company, much less try to make friends with big people
                                                or get into good books of high officers. Satsangis should always avoid the company
                                                of men who are altogether Sansaris (worldly) and are engrossed in the objects of
                                                this world and avoid social intercourse with such people.</li>
                                            <li>The moral code of the Faith for the regulation of worldly dealings or affairs is that
                                                a man should behave towards others as he would wish that others should act towards
                                                him.</li>
                                            <li>It is not proper to speak ill of, or show disrespect to other religions, the followers
                                                of any religion or any deity, religious leader, or to an old venerable person unnecessarily,
                                                nor to desecrate mausoleums or holy places.</li>
                                            <li>One should not torment others under the cover and protection of this Holiest of holy
                                                names.</li>
                                        </ul>

                                        The condition of the devotee should be like that of a child who has just commenced to learn swimming under the guidance of
                                        an expert swimmer. If a novice begins to drown, he clings to the hands of the coach with
                                        all his might. So, should the devotee cling to the Sant Sat Guru in his deadly combat with
                                        the forces of Kal (destiny, messenger of death) and

                                        &emsp;&emsp;It is not unusual to see puzzling behavior around our Holy places. People who indulge in these are ignorant. Others, also ignorant, are quick to follow them blindly. A few examples of such behavior are given below:

                                        <b>(a)</b>&emsp;In the matter of paying obeisance at wooden sandals of Soamiji Maharaj in Samadh, people are seen behaving in a puzzling manner. The correct way is that one should withdraw inwards and then pay obeisance. One should move away after paying obeisance to make way for others. But such is the ignorance in people that they do not move away but remain there for a long time, paying obeisance to the right, left, front and rear, on the platform, below the platform and sometimes rubbing their heads, sometimes wiping their hand there, behaving in a strange way.  This is nothing but harassing those standing behind them waiting for their turn to pay obeisance.
                                        <br/>
                                        <br/>
                                        <b>(b)</b>&emsp;On obeisance to Radhasoami with 'folded hands' or 'many salutations with folded hands' - truly this is what the commandment is.
                                        However, some people are seen opening their palms on the sandals, instead of folding them. They do not understand the significance of folding hands. They think that since they are supplicating for something, they should spread out their palms to receive it instead of joining or folding them. And what do they supplicate for? The same worldly objects they cherish. When they pay obeisance at the Samadh or Palang (bedstead) they keep their palms open. It is a matter to ponder that while paying obeisance we think that Babuji Maharaj is present and we are touching His Holy Feet. Do we touch the feet with our palms or with the back of the palms? 
                                        <br/><br/>&emsp;&emsp;The two currents emanating from the third Til and going to the two eyes have been termed as Kar or Hath (hands). The meaning of joining the two hands is to withdraw those two currents and unite or concentrate them at the third Til. Therefore, at the time of paying obeisance one should join the two hands — palm to palm — and not spread them out. 
                                        <br/>

                                        <b>(c)</b>&emsp;Life-size portraits of all the Sant Sat Gurus have been hung up in the Samadh of Soamiji Maharaj, for which purpose Samadh is the right place. The visitors to Samadh often enquire about Radhasoami Faith and its Acharyas (leaders). Thus they have Darshan of the Sant Sat Gurus and the Satsangis who daily go there to attend Satsang and pay obeisance also get Their Darshan. But some ignorant persons pay obeisance by putting their forehead on the walls and pillars beneath the portraits, and seeing them  many others also do the same.  This results in the permanent staining of the walls and pillars which look very awkward.
                                        One should pay obeisance only at the wooden sandals of Soamiji Maharaj. What is the use of rubbing one's forehead on the walls and pillars? The portraits have been  hung with the sole aim of enabling us to have Darshan, and not for paying obeisance at the walls and pillars.

                                        <b>(d)</b>&emsp;The Samadhs of Sants and the places where They used to stay, hold Satsang and perform Bhajan and Abhyas, are extremely sacred places. One should visit them with love and regard and show one's respect for them, but it would be wrong to think and consider that only by worshipping Samadh, one will attain salvation. In Sant Mat, prime importance has always been attached to the living Guru of the time. But it would also be foolish to say that as now we have found Sat Guru, we have nothing to do with anyone else, we are not going to visit Samadh, nor shall we do this or do that.

                                    &emsp;&emsp;Concept of 'Arti' and the manner and significance of performing Arti Ceremony. The Satsang held on the occasions of annual Bhandaras of Param Purush Pooran Dhani Soamiji Maharaj, Huzur Maharaj, Maharaj Saheb and Babuji Maharaj, and the auspicious days of Guru Purnima, Basant and Holi is known as `Arti Satsang'. On these special occasions Bhent is offered and Prashad distributed after Satsang.

                                    &emsp;&emsp;<b><u>What does `Arti Satsang' signify.</u></b>
                                    <br/> &emsp;&emsp;Arti Shabds should be recited not only on the occasions of annual Bhandaras
                                    and auspicious days of Guru Purnima, Basant and Holi but also on any special function or
                                    ceremony where a lot of Satsangis have gathered. On all such occasions the recitation should
                                    commence with Arti Shabd. What Maharaj Saheb has written about `Arti' in Article 58 of His
                                    book 'Discourses on Radhasoami Faith' is reproduced below :
                                    <br/>
                                    <br/>
                                    &emsp;&emsp;"At times, disciples are permitted to gaze intently at the eyes of an adept, and he also
                                    directs his gaze similarly at the eyes and forehead of the devotees engaged in this practice.
                                    Meanwhile, holy pieces dealing with the ascent and journey of the spiritual entity upwards,
                                    towards the region of pure spirituality, or containing a description of the conditions
                                    of deep love and yearning, or of true humility and resignation to the will of the Supreme
                                    Creator, which befall a devotee during his course of spiritual journey, are recited.
                                    During this recital, the practice of spiritual contemplation has to be performed with
                                    the aid of the adept's gaze. The spiritual concentration during such moments is very
                                    great, and the devotees who are performing this practice are filled within themselves
                                    with rapturous bliss. When the concentration is beyond the strain to which a devotee
                                    is accustomed, his eyes involuntarily close, but during this condition he is all along
                                    conscious inwardly, and does not lose his identity like a hypnotised subject. The aid
                                    received in the course of this practice, which is technically known as the 'Arti' ceremony,
                                    is very similar to the aid extended to a child, who is just beginning to walk, by its
                                    mother or nurse, the object of this assistance rendered being to arouse the potentialities
                                    of the spirit-entity concurrently with the functions of free-will and self-consciousness".
                                    <br/>
                                    <br/>
                                    &emsp;&emsp;In `Prem Patra Radhasoami, Vol. V,' Discourse 34, Sahaj Updesh, paragraphs 73-74, Huzur Maharaj has described
                                    the method and benefit of performing Arti thus— 
                                    <br/>
                                    <br/>
                                    &emsp;&emsp;"There is prevalent in Satsang, what is known as the Arti ceremony. Holy pieces of love and
                                    devotion are recited. The person who is to perform Arti sits in front of Sat Guru. He
                                    gazes intently at the eyes of Sat Guru. Concentrating his mind, he follows the recitation,
                                    and fixes his Surat (spirit) at the first or second stage. This is in fact the Abhyas
                                    of Dhyan. The mind does not, however, apply to Dhyan so well as it does in the presence
                                    of Sat Guru. In the latter case, the thoughts of the world do not arise in the mind,
                                    and greater bliss and joy are experienced because the Abhyas is aided by the glance of
                                    Sat Guru. Often five, ten or more persons perform Arti ceremony. They take their seat
                                    before Sat Guru. For every one of them, one or two Shabds (holy pieces) are recited separately.
                                    Till all the Artis (holy pieces) are finished, all of them keep sitting before Sat Guru
                                    with their eyes fixed on His Darshan and their mind concentrated, and enjoy bliss and
                                    happiness within them.
                                    <br/>
                                    <br/>
                                    &emsp;&emsp;When the Artis are over, everyone who performs Arti, offers Bhet according
                                    to his desire and capacity. Either some or all of them bring sweets to be distributed
                                    as Prashad among those present in Satsang. At the commencement of the Arti, garlands
                                    are presented to Sat Guru, who returns them to offerers after sanctifying them. After
                                    making Bhent and receiving back garlands, they touch His Holy Feet with their foreheads
                                    and pay obeisance with folded hands, looking at the same time into His eyes."
                                    <br/>
                                    <br/>
                                    &emsp;&emsp;After Huzur Maharaj’s departure, this practice of Arti in Satsang ceased to exist. Now-a-days Arti Satsang means
                                    that in Satsang Arti Shabds are particularly recited. Arti-Shabds refer to the Shabds which
                                    give an account of the elevation of Surat. The method of performing Arti now is that as the
                                    names of different spheres of Brahmand and purely spiritual region, i.e., from Sahas-dal-kanwal
                                    to Radhasoami Dham are mentioned during the recitation of Arti Shabds, one should turn one's
                                    Surat towards each of those spheres and should fix it there with the help of the Darshan
                                    of Guru Swarup. By such practice one gets the fruit of Abhyas.
                                    <br/>
                                    <br/>
                                    &emsp;&emsp;On the perusal of the captions of Chapters or Bachans of `Sar Bachan Radhasoami
                                    Poetry' and `Prem Bani Radhasoami' it will be quite clear that no where it has been mentioned
                                    that such and such Shabd is meant for reciting on the occasion of a wedding or any other
                                    specific occasion. However, there are a few Shabds which are recited on particular occasions.
                                    But as such there is no hard and fast rule. It will only amount to mechanizing the recitation
                                    killing and suppressing the enthusiasm, love and devotion.

                Soamiji Maharaj, the first
                Sant Sat Guru, He brought with Him five Surats also known as ‘Nij Ansh’ viz. (i)
                Radhaji Maharaj, (ii) Huzur Maharaj, (iii) Maharaj Saheb, (iv) Buaji Saheba and (v)
                Babuji Maharaj. By 1861 all These Surats were present together on this planet. An
                introduction of all These Surats is given below. The details for each of Them can
                be found in Their respective biographies.

                            &emsp;&emsp;Param Purush Puran Dhani (The Most Supreme and the Most Perfect Being) Soamiji
                            Maharaj is the first Sant Sat Guru
                            and the August Founder of Radhasoami Faith. He was born at Panni Gali, in the city
                            of Agra, on the night of the eighth day of the dark half of Bhadon (Janmashtami),
                            at half past twelve, in the year 1875 of Vikram Calendar (corresponding to night
                            between 24-25<sup>th</sup> August, 1818 A.D. He was the Perfect Incarnation of Radhasoami
                            Dayal and
                            had made advent in this world to awaken and redeem the Jivas.

                        <br /><br />&emsp;&emsp;Soamiji Maharaj’s name was “Shiv Dayal Singh Seth”. This worldly name of
                        Soamiji Maharaj also has a special significance.
                        Soamiji Maharaj did not descend below the Third Til. Above the third Til is the location
                        of Shiv, hence “Shiv” figures in His name. Shiv is a destroyer. But Soamiji Maharaj was
                        Dayal Purush, the merciful. Therefore, His name was “Shiv Dayal”. For destroying Kal
                        and Maya He was like a lion (Singh). Therefore the full name “Shiv Dayal Singh”. A rich
                        businessman or a rich person (Dhani) is called “Seth”. And Seth is a caste among Khatris.
                        The real wealth is the wealth of spirituality. Soamiji Maharaj was the “Seth” of spiritual
                        wealth. There are 7 letters in Shiv Dayal Singh in Hindi (शि व द या ल सिं ह). When Radhasoami
                        Dayal, the Lord of Radhasoami Dham, which is situated beyond the seven regions of
                        Sahas-dal-kanwal,
                        Trikuti, Sunn, Bhanwargupha, Sat Lok, Alakh Lok and Agam Lok assumed human form in this
                        world, then He came to be known as Shiv Dayal Singh.
                        <br /><br /> &emsp;&emsp;Soamiji Maharaj was the Incarnation of the eighth region, the highest
                        spiritual
                        region, and was born on the eighth day. Eighth day is the Madhya or middle of a fortnight.
                        Bhadon being the sixth month is the middle of the year. The time of His birth was half
                        past 12 midnight, which is also the Madhya, i.e. the midpoint between 12:00 AM and 1:00
                        AM. Everything about His birth was thus in the Madhya, i.e. middle or centre.
                        <br /><br /> &emsp;&emsp;The Lord could not come lower down in the same form as His intense
                        spirituality
                        would have caused destruction to these regions. He had, therefore, to cover Himself with
                        the materials (if the word can appropriately be used) constituting these regions, and
                        had to associate Himself with the subtlest form of the materials to be found there. The
                        subtlest form of the three Gunas’ i.e. ‘Sat’, ‘Raj’ and ‘Tam’, appeared from Trikuti
                        in a formless condition but when they descended from Sahas-dal-kanwal, they had form.
                        Five ‘Tattwas’ also came down from there and thus these 3 ‘Gunas’ and 5 ‘Tattwas’ or
                        elements (5+3=8) constitute the major part of the materials of Brahmand. So the Lord
                        had to assume covers of these regions and it took eight days, as they are eight in number.
                        He had to put on eight kinds of covers. This process took eight periods. Hence the Incarnation
                        of Radhasoami Dayal, i.e., Soamiji Maharaj, manifested Himself on the eighth day of the
                        dark fortnight of ‘Bhadon’. The choice of the Janmashtami day or the eighth day, for
                        His advent, was the natural result of this process.
                        <br /><br /> &emsp;&emsp;At the tender age of six-seven years, He started explaining Parmarth of
                        the highest order to selected men and women. Soamiji Maharaj had no guru, nor did He
                        receive instructions in Parmarth from anyone. On the other hand, He explained Parmarth
                        to His parents and a number of Sadhus who came to Him.
                        <br /><br /> &emsp;&emsp;Soamiji Maharaj possessed an extremely handsome appearance and
                        personality
                        and each part of His body was most attractive. He was of middle height, of very fair
                        complexion and of a delicate, yet very proportionate, constitution. His eyes were brilliant
                        and lustrous and His forehead was open and broad. To cast a look at Him was to realize
                        the presence of someone unusually attractive and magnetic. It was not easy for a man
                        to fix his gaze upon Him. To look intently at His eyes was possible only if He was pleased
                        to permit it.
                        <br /><br /> &emsp;&emsp;Soamiji Maharaj would, for days together, shut Himself up in a small
                        room
                        and remain absorbed in the bliss of Surat Shabd Yoga. There was no knowing when He would
                        need water, food or rest. He ate sparingly. Radhaji Maharaj used to soak a few raisins
                        in water at night, and next morning She would offer that water to Soamiji Maharaj as
                        a mild laxative and distribute the raisins among the children. The food contents of such
                        raisin water can well be imagined than described. But even this meagre quantity was sufficient
                        for Soamiji Maharaj. Ordinarily, one takes food in good quantity, although a very little
                        portion of it is actually necessary for keeping the body fit and going, the rest being
                        wasted. As against this, Sants and Sadhs eat very little and sort the subtle food out
                        of it. By their spiritual power they are able to finish every work very quickly, easily
                        and with perfection, which is not possible for an ordinary man.
                        <br /><br /> &emsp;&emsp;Huzur Maharaj, one of the Nij Ansh and the second Sant Sat Guru, while
                        performing
                        the practice of Surat Shabd Yoga, heard the sound of Radhasoami emanating from the highest
                        region and upon reaching there found unity of Radhasoami Dayal and Soamiji Maharaj. Then
                        he started addressing Soamiji Maharaj with the same name i.e. ‘Radhasoami’. Gradually
                        the Updesh (Initiation) and Abhyas (spiritual practice) of Radhasoami Nam and Dham was
                        commenced. At this time, a few men and women came to Soamiji Maharaj and, greatly impressed
                        with His Darshan and discourses, became His devotees. This gathering kept on increasing
                        day by day and it is to this group’s deserving Jivas that Soamiji Maharaj gave the secret
                        of Radhasoami Nam. And these deserving Surats, having high spiritual status, started
                        addressing Soamiji Maharaj by the same name.
                        <br /><br /> &emsp;&emsp;Soamiji Maharaj started holding Satsang at His residence on Basant
                        Panchmi
                        day in Samvat 1917 Vikram (Friday, the 15
                        <sup>th</sup> February, 1861). This Satsang continued day and night for seventeen and a half
                        years. Sometimes discourses, which began in the evening, continued till midnight or even
                        next morning. About ten thousand persons were initiated into Radhasoami Faith. They were
                        mostly Hindus, from different provinces (States). Some Mohammedans, Jains and Christians
                        were also initiated. Soon the fame of the new and unique faith of Soamiji Maharaj spread
                        everywhere, far and near, and people from Agra and other places started coming to listen
                        to the discourses of Soamiji Maharaj in large numbers. These included Christian priests
                        and Sadhus of various sects. Many of them held discussions in groups with Soamiji Maharaj,
                        and would go fully satisfied with the Bachans (discourses) of Soamiji Maharaj. By disclosing
                        the practice of Surat Shabd Yoga, the Supreme Being Radhasoami Dayal has made the method
                        of meeting Him so easy that the difficult practice of restraining breath has been totally
                        stopped. He prescribed such a practice, that an old man of 80 years, and a young boy
                        of 8 years, can also perform it.
                        <br /><br /> &emsp;&emsp;“Sar Bachan Radhasoami Poetry”, which is also called “Bari Bani” (Great
                        book of Hymns), was dictated by Soamiji Maharaj Himself. In 1861, on the commencement
                        of general Satsang on Basant Panchmi, Soamiji Maharaj commenced the writing and dictating
                        of Hymns. Most of the time this Sewa was taken from Lala Jiwan Lal Ji. But sometimes
                        Soamiji Maharaj used to take this Sewa from Huzur Maharaj also. Soamiji Maharaj would
                        dictate and Lala Jiwan Lal Ji and Huzur Maharaj would keep writing it down.
                        <br /><br /> &emsp;&emsp;As is apparent from the name itself, this book is filled with
                        invaluable
                        essence of discourses. These have been uttered by the Supreme Being Radhasoami Dayal
                        Himself. This book has more than 200 Arabic words and about 100 Persian words. How can
                        one describe its glory? The compositions are filled with high Spirituality and deep knowledge.
                        When one withdraws one’s attention from outside and concentrates one’s Surat and mind
                        within to some extent and then reads or listens to the Hymns, one will derive its complete
                        bliss.
                        <br /><br /> &emsp;&emsp;Soamiji Maharaj’s Hymns are of a very high spiritual level and are full
                        of the glory of Radhasoami. From the beginning to end, it has been said that
                        <b>Radhasoami Nam and Radhasoami Dham are above all and the highest.</b>
                        <br /><br /> &emsp;&emsp;“Sar Bachan Radhasoami Prose” which has discourses was also dictated by
                        Soamiji Maharaj Himself.
                        <br /><br /> &emsp;&emsp;Soamiji Maharaj had spoken to Huzur Maharaj about His departure about
                        two
                        years before hand. Upon Huzur Maharaj’s repeated prayers to Soamiji Maharaj for the suspension
                        of that Mauj, Soamiji Maharaj agreed to retain His mortal coil for some more time. After
                        some time, when again Soamiji Maharaj stated that He would leave the mortal coil after
                        five days, Huzur Maharaj was deeply saddened and felt very sorrowful. Huzur Maharaj again
                        pleaded that if such a Mauj is not ordained now, it will be great Daya (kindness) on
                        Jivas. On this, Soamiji Maharaj stated that this physical body has become decrepit and
                        it is not acceptable to retain it. Huzur Maharaj again requested that Daya may kindly
                        be shown for a few days more. On this, Soamiji Maharaj accepted the request to maintain
                        His physical body for another fifteen days, but said that such a request should not be
                        made again because if I refuse, My heart does not feel like saying no and it also does
                        not appear proper to keep this human body any longer. After fifteen days, on Asad Badi
                        1 (Padwa), Samvat 1935 Vikram, Saturday, 15
                        <sup>th</sup> June 1878, after getting His Arti performed by Huzur Maharaj and other Satsangis
                        and Sadhus, He departed at about 1:45 pm in the afternoon.
                        <br /><br /> &emsp;&emsp;On the departure day, at about 8 A.M., Soamiji Maharaj observed that
                        the
                        time of His departure was then near at hand. Thereafter, Soamiji Maharaj withdrew His
                        Surat (spirit) and also all diffused spirituality. A quarter of an hour later, He brought
                        down His Surat and then declared that “Mauj has now changed and there is still some time”.
                        Then Lala Pratap Singh (youngest brother of Soamiji Maharaj) enquired “When is the Mauj
                        now?” Soamiji Maharaj replied, “Sometime in the afternoon”. Then Sudarshan Singh enquired
                        to whom one should refer one’s Parmarthi queries. Thereupon, Soamiji Maharaj replied,
                        <b>“Whosoever has anything to ask, must refer it to Salig Ram (Huzur Maharaj)”.</b> Thereafter
                        He said, “No Satsangi, whether a house-holder or a Sadhu, should worry at all. I am constantly
                        with everyone, and greater care of all will be taken in future ....... Satsang must go
                        on. Satsang shall spread far and wide in future”.
                        <br /><br /> &emsp;&emsp;Annual Bhandara of Soamiji Maharaj was fixed by Huzur Maharaj as Asad
                        Badi
                        (Padwa) for first 50 years. Then onwards, the annual Bhandara is being held on Bhadon
                        Badi (Janmashtami) as fixed by Babuji Maharaj, the fourth Sant Sat Guru of Radhasoami
                        Faith.

                            <h4 style="color: #337ab7">RADHAJI MAHARAJ</h4>
                            Radhaji Maharaj was one of the Nij Anshas that Soamiji Maharaj brought along with Him. But
                            She did not function as a Sant
                            Sat Guru. However, Her role was quite significant. Radhaji Maharaj's name was Narain
                            Dei. At the time of marriage Soamiji Maharaj said of Her that by virtue of Her high
                            spiritual status and affinity to Him, She was destined to be with Him; so let the
                            marriage be performed. Later on, He said that She was a Nij Ansh and came with Him
                            from the August Abode; She was Nij Adi Radha Dhar. So She should be addressed as
                            Radhaji.
                            <a style="cursor: pointer" id="readmor1" onclick="functionexpand1()">
                                <u>Read More..</u>
                            </a>
                        </div>
                    </div>
                    <div id="readmore2" style="text-align: justify;display:none;padding-right:50px;">
                        <br /> &emsp;&emsp;On seeing Soamiji Maharaj's countenance, Radhaji Maharaj became oblivious
                        of Her body, mind and everything. Soamiji Maharaj alone was Her life and support. Soamiji
                        Maharai used to explain Parmarthi matters of the highest order to Radhaji Maharaj, when
                        she had come to Agra, after marriage. She heard His discourses in Satsang as well.
                        <br /><br /> &emsp;&emsp;Soamiji Maharaj would, for days together, shut Himself up in a small
                        room
                        and remain absorbed in the bliss of Surat Shabd Yoga. There was no knowing when He would
                        need water, food or rest. It was also not certain at what time of day or night, He would
                        require anything. So, Radhaji Maharaj had to be in attendance on Him all the time, if
                        not physically, at least mentally and spiritually. Amid the hustle and bustle of Her
                        multifarious duties and activities, Her attention was always riveted on Soamiji Maharaj
                        and His requirements. It was Radhaji Maharaj alone who could do this. Though fully devoting
                        Herself to Parmarthi activities, there was no letup in the discharge of Her multifarious
                        household duties.
                        <br /><br /> &emsp;&emsp;A very cool and serene current was present in Her. She had not assumed
                        the
                        human form just to do the household duties, though She would be seen to be busy preparing
                        food for the family and Satsangis and doing similar things. She Was a Nij Ansh (special
                        emanation) of Radhasoami Dayal. She was a most powerful cool current personified.
                        <br /><br /> &emsp;&emsp;To an important question, "Whom have you appointed to look after and
                        guide
                        us?" Thereupon Soamiji Maharaj replied, "Radhaji for ladies and Sanmukh Das for Sadhus".
                        Ladies should not go to the garden (Soami Bagh) to serve and pay respects to any Sadhu.
                        They should all worship Radhaji and have Her Darshan. Addressing Rai Salig Ram (Huzur
                        Maharaj), all Sadhus, Satsangis and Satsangins, Soamiji Maharaj observed, "You should
                        give Radhaji the same place in your estimation as you gave me, and should treat Radhaji
                        and Chhoti Mata Ji alike."
                        <br /><br /> &emsp;&emsp;Radhaji Maharaj had not any function assigned to Her as in the case of
                        the
                        Gurumukh. Her mere presence was enough to ensure the fulfilment of the mission for which
                        She had come with Soamiji Maharaj. Being the embodiment of Adi Surat (the prime Spirit-Current),
                        She had a special love for and affinity with the spirit entities in these regions and
                        exercised a peculiar attractive influence on them. This expedited their emergence from
                        the stress of mind and matter.
                        <br /><br /> &emsp;&emsp;Radhaji Maharaj survived Soamiji Maharaj by more than sixteen years.
                        During
                        these years She nursed the Satsang started by Soamiji Maharaj and saw that His successor
                        Huzur Maharaj did not meet with opposition from the members of Her family and others.
                        An eminent author/compiler of Chadu Panchang (almanac), has, on the basis of Soamiji
                        Maharaj's horoscope, calculated Radhaji Maharaj's date of birth as Ashwin Sudi 5, Samvat
                        1884 Vikram, corresponding to Tuesday, the 26
                        <sup>th</sup> September 1827, but nothing can be said about its accuracy. She departed from
                        this world on November 1st, 1894. Her ashes are kept with those of Soamiji Maharaj in
                        the Holy Samadh at Soami Bagh, Agra. A small portion is also kept in Radha Bagh. Radhaji
                        Maharaj's Bhandara was held on Saturday, 1
                        <sup>st</sup> December 1894, in Agra. Buaji Saheba was also present on that occasion as is
                        evident from one of the letters of Huzur Maharaj to Maharaj Saheb.

                            &emsp;&emsp;Huzur Maharaj was the second Sant Sat Guru of the Radhasoami Faith. He succeeded
                            Soamiji Maharaj. Huzur Maharaj
                            was born at half past four in the morning on Friday, the 14
                            <sup>th</sup> March 1829, at Pipal Mandi, in a Kayasth family. Kayasth literally means,
                            "situated in the body, the Supreme Being or Spirit". The duration of pregnancy in
                            woman is usually nine months. Huzur Maharaj was however, born after eighteen months
                            and the body too was developed as of a child of eighteen months. But nothing unusual
                            was felt by the revered mother.

                        <br /><br /> &emsp;&emsp;Huzur Maharaj's name was Salig Ram. He had his early education in a
                        Maktab
                        (primary school for boys) where he acquired proficiency in the Persian language. No University
                        having then been established, he passed the Senior Examination in English from the Agra
                        College, Agra. It was the highest degree in those days. Huzur Maharaj took interest in
                        Astrology, Logic, Theology and Philosophy as well, which he studied as hobbies. He used
                        to explain intricate and subtle points of Astrology with such felicity and clarity that
                        left the listeners wondering. He translated Sanskrit books of Astrology into Persian,
                        and thus made this science available to Persian-knowing people.
                        <br /><br /> &emsp;&emsp;The spiritual instinct of Huzur Maharaj had begun to manifest itself in
                        his very childhood. When according to the custom prevalent in his community, he was required
                        to take initiation from the family guru, the Gosain of Mathura Bindraban, at the age
                        of eight or nine years, he put to him some intricate questions which the latter could
                        not answer satisfactorily. Huzur Maharaj refused to have him as his Guru. However, when
                        pressed, he agreed on the condition that whenever he found out a true and perfect adept,
                        he would be free to accept him as his Guru.
                        <br /><br /> &emsp;&emsp;The first memorable meeting between Soamiji Maharaj and Huzur Maharaj
                        took
                        place in 1858. A Sunday was fixed for the interview. Huzur Maharaj came in the morning.
                        Soamiji Maharaj cordially seated him in the same room where He used to perform Abhyas
                        and which is inside another room. Huzur Maharaj related all about himself and asked several
                        questions on Parmarth (religion), to which he received very satisfactory answers. This
                        first audience lasted for nearly five hours. On coming out, Huzur Maharaj broke forth
                        that he had found the One whom he had been seeking for so long. He added that since his
                        very boyhood be had been praying, 'O my Lord! meet me Thyself'. His prayer had been granted,
                        He had met the Supreme Being Himself.
                        <br /><br /> &emsp;&emsp;The family of Huzur Maharaj consisted of religious-minded persons with
                        catholic
                        virtues. His Father Munshi Bahadur Singh, a lawyer by profession, was a great devotee
                        of Shiva. He kept with him only as much as was needed to meet the household expenses.
                        Rest, he gave away in charity. So would Huzur Maharaj place his entire monthly emoluments
                        at the Holy Feet of his Guru, Soamiji Maharaj. Huzur Maharaj's mother was a good natured,
                        intelligent and pious lady. After the demise of Huzur Maharaj's father, she brought up
                        and educated the children astonishingly well.
                        <br /><br /> &emsp;&emsp;Huzur Maharaj's was a full-fledged household life with large progeny
                        and
                        great fortune, entailing at the same time, equally great responsibilities and burdens.
                        Even amidst the hustle and bustle of such a life he performed devotion, singular in its
                        kind, to Soamiji Maharaj. Huzur Maharaj, in general appearance, was well built above
                        medium height and graceful in gait and speach. His refulgent forehead, flowing beard,
                        uplifted eyes and beatific countenance struck men at once with reverence and love. He
                        exercised an irresistible personal charm and attraction on all those who came in contact
                        with Him. The whole atmosphere of the place in which He lived was surcharged with love
                        and attraction which even a casual visitor would feel and realize. He was generous and
                        benevolent to the extreme, just as a mother is to her children. Huzur Maharaj's place
                        was verily a perennial source for the flow of spirituality from the feet of the Supreme
                        Father to this arid and barren part of creation.
                        <br /><br /> &emsp;&emsp;At the age of 18, Huzur Maharaj entered Government service. He got an
                        appointment
                        in the office of the Postmaster General. He was deputed to Saharanpur in 1850, and then
                        to Allahabad in 1851, on special duty and in recognition of his good work, was made,
                        on 1
                        <sup>st</sup> April 1852, an Inspecting Postmaster. On 1
                        <sup>st</sup> July 1852, Huzur Maharaj was made the Head Assistant in the office of the
                        Postmaster
                        General. In 1868, Huzur Maharaj was promoted as Personal Assistant to the Postmaster
                        General and on 31
                        <sup>st</sup> August 1871, the title of Rai Bahadur was conferred on him as a mark of personal
                        distinction. He was, since then, known in official circles as Rai Salig Ram Bahadur.
                        On the 28
                        <sup>th</sup> April 1881, he had the unique honour of being the first Indian to be made the
                        Postmaster General of the North Western Frontier Provinces which then included Uttar
                        Pradesh, Punjab, Rajasthan and Madhya Pradesh. Huzur Maharaj's name is still remembered
                        in connection with the introduction of one-pice post card and is associated with many
                        reforms relating to cheap postal services and facilities of which the inhabitants of
                        poor and economically under-developed countries like India could take full advantage.
                        He was recognized as the beacon light of truth, virtue and efficiency in the department.
                        Throughout his career, Huzur Maharaj won praise and admiration everywhere. Although almost
                        the whole of his time and attention were devoted to the service of Soamiji Maharaj, there
                        was not the least deterioration in the quality and the magnitude of the work entrusted
                        to him as an important and high officer of the postal department. Without a single mistake,
                        He discharged his duties well. He moved from one department to another, accepting added
                        responsibilities with cheerfulness and efficiency. In consideration of his distinguished
                        services, his excellent conduct, the Secretary of State for India, granted him a special
                        pension. Huzur Maharaj, throughout his service career, experienced special grace and
                        mercy of Radhasoami Dayal. Often, while on tour, he had to pass through dangerous routes,
                        forests and hillocks, and cross swollen rivers and brooks, at any hour of the day or
                        night. But the protecting hand of Radhasoami Dayal was always on his head.
                        <br /><br /> &emsp;&emsp;Huzur Maharaj was in Soamiji Maharaj's Satsang for about twenty years
                        during
                        which period he served His Guru with His body, mind and riches with singular loyalty
                        and singleness of devotion of which it is impossible to find a parallel. For a long time
                        he used to fetch a pitcher of pure water on his shoulder for Soamiji Maharaj from a well
                        two miles away. For this he walked barefooted on the stone pavements in hot summer of
                        May and June. He used to grind flour for Soamiji Maharaj's bread. He used to press the
                        feet, operate manual fan, fill the Huqqa, cook food, bathe Him, clean and paint the house,
                        pluck twigs from Neem trees to be used as brush, clean toilet & drain, wash dishes, bring
                        goods from the market, lift Him on his shoulders, carry the palanquin, run with the vehicle,
                        offer spittoon, handle the whisk etc. He used to dig deep to get clean earth for washing
                        His hands. Every morning he used to sweep the rooms and verandahs of Soamiji Maharaj's
                        house. He performed all kinds of high and low services. All these gave him pleasure and
                        satisfaction. Huzur Maharaj performed these Sewas (services) with a verve and gusto that
                        was a pure joy to watch.
                        <br /><br /> &emsp;&emsp;Huzur Maharaj attended on Soamiji Maharaj from twelve to fifteen hours
                        a
                        day. After the establishment of General Stasang in 1861, when Soamiji Maharaj took up
                        the composition of Sar Bachan Radhasoami Poetry, Huzur Maharaj would take down dictation
                        for hours together. He would also attend on Soamiji Maharaj's correspondence. The historic
                        letter given in chapter 27, Biography of Huzur Maharaj, was written by Huzur Maharaj under
                        instructions from Soamiji
                        Maharaj.
                        <br /><br /> &emsp;&emsp;Soamiji Maharaj had ordained that, in future, Satsang would spread far
                        and
                        wide. This exactly happened in the time of Huzur Maharaj. On His retirement from Government
                        service, when Huzur Maharaj held Satsang at Agra, thousands of people received initiation
                        into Radhasoami Faith. They flocked from every part of India, viz., Bengal, Punjab, Sindh,
                        Deccan, Rajputana, Bombay, Central India, etc., and received spiritual benefit. Satsang
                        was held several times during day and night. Huzur Maharaj's discourses were very sweet
                        and impressive. He used to reveal the secrets of Radhasoami religion in such a unique
                        and new manner every time that the audience was wonder struck. Sometimes persons would
                        come in batches at different hours and Huzur Maharaj would discuss religion with each
                        of them in entirely different manners, from different view points and in new and varied
                        forms. A listener would, at once, become His slave. Adhikari Jivas were coming over from
                        long distances as if under a magnetic pull. Satsangis used to get many experiences of
                        grace, mercy and protection, but were forbidden to disclose them to anybody. "It is the
                        pleasure of the Supreme Being that whatever He does by His grace and mercy should not
                        be made public. It, therefore, behoves a true Parmarthi not to speak out to anybody about
                        the grace which he experiences internally or by which his affairs are satisfactorily
                        managed. He should offer thanks to the Supreme Being internally. Of course, he is not
                        prohibited from giving indications of such experiences to Parmarthis and loving devotees
                        on some special occasions, because they also have experiences of such grace and mercy
                        and Mauj in their own affairs". He was all-powerful. He showed that no one can know the
                        secrets of Sants unless They themselves are pleased to impart the same to Jivas. Huzur
                        Maharaj used to give very patient hearing. Satsangis would often relate their petty household
                        affairs. But Huzur Maharaj would never scold anybody. At the most, He would say, "Brother,
                        you are talking about such a proposition that nothing can be said". Anger was miles away
                        from Him. He used to take very little rest. All the time He was busy in holding Satsang,
                        delivering discourses, explaining Parmarth to new entrants, dictating replies to the
                        letters of Satsangis, Bachans of Prem Patras. Huzur Maharaj used to put on different
                        types of dresses. It was really a wondrous sight to see Him in coat and cap made of velvet
                        with embroidery work on them, walking down the incline, on His way to Panni Gali, with
                        His hand resting on the shoulder of Maharaj Saheb and Satsangis following in procession.
                        <br /><br /> &emsp;&emsp;About a week before His departure, Huzur Maharaj strolled a few rounds
                        in
                        the verandah of Prem Bilas, casting His gaze on the Satsangis present. Someone said,
                        "Today Huzur's health appears to be better. Huzur Maharaj observed, "Sants are great
                        Thagias (masters at befooling)". On the evening of 6
                        <sup>th</sup> December at 6:40 PM, Huzur Maharaj enquired as to what time it was then and
                        ordered the pillows and bolsters to be arranged on the bedstead. And after five minutes
                        He left his mortal coil. His eyes were shining and face was lustrous and refulgent. Huzur
                        Maharaj's body lay in state for three days to allow numerous Satsangis from far off places
                        to have a last glimpse of Him. Huzur Maharaj's Samadh was built in Prem Bilas exactly
                        on the spot where He left His mortal coil. His first Bhandara was held on 27
                        <sup>th</sup> December 1898.
                        <br /><br /> &emsp;&emsp;A large number of books, big and small, and treatises in prose and
                        verse,
                        were written to the dictation of Huzur Maharaj, all printed and published in His time.
                        They can be classified in four categories viz. (i) Prem Bani in verse, (ii) Prem Patra
                        in prose, (iii) Booklets in Hindi and Urdu and (iv) Radhasoami Mat Prakash in English.

                            &emsp;&emsp;Maharaj Saheb was the third Sant Sat Guru of Radhasoami Faith. He was born in
                            Piyari Kalan, Kabir Chaura, Varanasi,
                            on Thursday, the 28<sup>th</sup> March 1861. Maharaj Saheb's name was Brahm Shankar. Huzur
                            Maharaj had given Maharaj Saheb the Parmarthi name 'Premanand'.
                            <a id="readmor3" onclick="functionexpand3()" style="cursor: pointer">

                    <div id="readmore4" style="text-align: justify;display:none;padding-right:50px;">
                        <br /><br /> &emsp;&emsp;Maharaj Saheb was born in a highly respected Brahmin family of
                        intellectuals.
                        A deep religious inclination and a broad and independent outlook required for spiritual
                        advancement were not lacking in it. This is borne out of the fact that His father Pandit
                        Ramjasan Misra, though belonging to a staunchly conservative family of Sanatani Brahmins
                        accepted a famous Muslim Fakir of Patna as his Guru without any fear or opprobrium.
                        <br /><br /> &emsp;&emsp;Maharaj Saheb got married at a very early age. His consort was just
                        nine
                        at the time of marriage. She was younger by six months to Maharaj Saheb. She was called
                        ‘Naiyaji’ .Huzur Maharaj had given the Parmarthi name 'Shabd Pyari' to Naiyanji. One
                        day Naiyanji prayed to Huzur Maharaj to deliver a discourse. Huzur Maharaj replied, "Don't
                        worry, you will be having discourses at your own house," adding "the next Sant Incarnate
                        will be in a Brahmin family."
                        <br /><br /> &emsp;&emsp;According to the traditions of the time, Maharaj Saheb paid much
                        attention
                        to body building, performed a lot of physical exercises. He was a great athlete and a
                        wrestler, ready to challenge any and everybody. The bad characters and even policemen
                        of Kashi (Varanasi) feared him. In contrast, Babuji Maharaj was lean, thin and short
                        statured. But, because both of them always moved together, people feared Babuji Maharaj
                        too and no one dared raise a finger against him. Maharaj Saheb had a liking for music
                        also. He played Sitar well. Whenever His father had a spell of heartache, He would play
                        Sitar which would lull him to sleep.
                        <br /><br /> &emsp;&emsp;At B.A, Maharaj Saheb had English Literature, Sanskrit and Physics as
                        His
                        subjects. He took His M.A. degree in English literature in 1884. On completion of His
                        education, Maharaj Saheb joined Bareilly College as a teacher. He also commenced the
                        study of law, but soon gave it up as the lawyer's profession did not suit His temperament.
                        Actually, the time for His joining the Satsang had come. The first meeting of Maharaj
                        Saheb and Huzur Maharaj was momentous. Maharaj Saheb and Babuji Maharaj went to the railway
                        station to receive Huzur Maharaj. Maharaj Saheb stood leaning against a lamp post waiting
                        for the train to arrive. The train steamed in and gradually came to a halt. Huzur Maharaj
                        was standing at the door of His compartment. No sooner Maharaj Saheb had Darshan (glimpse)
                        of Huzur Maharaj, than His Surat was so "strongly withdrawn towards the third Til, that
                        He was about to fall but Babuji Maharaj lent Him support. Maharaj Saheb stood leaning
                        against the lamp post. Maharaj Saheb was feeling the infusion of a strange power in Him.
                        He was having a new experience, which He could neither comprehend nor unfold to others.
                        A sort of electric current was flowing in His body. After having adopted Huzur Maharaj
                        as His Guru, Maharaj Saheb had practically withdrawn His attention from the world and
                        all that it stands for. That worried His mother very much. She often used to say that
                        her Munua had stopped eating and drinking everything. What sort of Guru he has adopted
                        that there is no knowing what might happen to Him.
                        <br /><br /> &emsp;&emsp;Maharaj Saheb got appointed as clerk with Accountant General's Office.
                        Within
                        six years of His appointment, Maharaj Saheb became a Superintendent. In 1905, He was
                        promoted as Chief Superintendent. This was the highest position in that department which
                        one could expect in those days. He held this post till He took leave preparatory to retirement.
                        His promotions to the post of Superintendent and Chief Superintendent were out of turn
                        and in supersession of His seniors. In fact, His unusual abilities entitled Him to much
                        higher promotions but He never courted them. On the other hand, His perfect contentment,
                        His total exclusiveness and indifference to all matters except what strictly constituted
                        His official duties and the desire to remain as near to His Guru as possible, were some
                        of the reasons why He was not promoted to class one of the Indian Audit and Accounts
                        Service. His superior officers agreed to give Him only what He could accept in the above
                        circumstances. He served for 20 years and received promotion after promotion. He was
                        nominated for Deputy Collectorship which He declined.
                        <br /><br /> &emsp;&emsp;Maharaj Saheb used to hold Satsang three times a day, early morning,
                        evening
                        and night.The audience consisting of both males and females numbered from three to seven
                        or eight hundred. Discourses were almost invariably delivered at each divine service
                        and their fame spread far and wide. Abstruse spiritual truths were elucidated on strictly
                        scientific lines. The supernatural flow and eloquence combined with the irresistible
                        logic of His discourses held the audiences consisting mostly of educated men spellbound.
                        They all listened with rapt attention and a feeling of deep veneration. Thousands of
                        persons were initiated by Him into the principles of Radhasoami Faith. A new element
                        of discipline and regimentation was introduced by Maharaj Saheb. Satsang was to commence
                        punctually irrespective of the change in the season both in the morning and in the evening
                        and sometimes at midnight also. Maharaj Saheb delivered discourses almost every day and
                        sometimes more than once in the day. The duration of each Satsang was quite long and
                        the audience was large and varied. There were separate places for seating men and women
                        and a separate shed for the children and their attendants so that they might not disturb
                        the Satsang.
                        <br /><br /> &emsp;&emsp;During Huzur Maharaj's time, signs had begun to make themselves visible
                        of a desire on the part of certain sections of Satsangis to form themselves into separate
                        groups and of the assertion by certain persons of the right of interest in properties
                        which had by that time come into the possession of the Satsang. In order to check this
                        disruptive tendency as also to obviate the difficulties which might arise during the
                        periods intervening between the succession of Gurus and to maintain the undisturbed continuity
                        of the management, Huzur Maharaj wanted to create a body to administer for all time the
                        property of the Satsang under the guidance of the Sant Sat Guru. In fact, a rough scheme
                        had been drawn out for the purpose. But before it could take a concrete form, Huzur Maharaj
                        departed from this world. This work was taken up in right earnest by Maharaj Saheb in
                        1902 resulting in the creation of a body called the Central Administrative Council and
                        its adjunct, the Radhasoami Trust, whose headquarters are located at Soami Bagh, Agra.
                        With the assemblage of a large number of persons with varied spiritual outlook and ambitions,
                        schisms are inevitable, but the organic unity of the parent stock, which is the custodian
                        of and maintains the original principles and teachings of the Founder in their pristine
                        purity, remains unaffected under the aegis of the Sant Sat Guru assisted by the Central
                        Administrative Council established by Maharaj Saheb. The parent stock consists of persons
                        whose ideals are to engage themselves in spiritual pursuits uncontaminated, as far as
                        possible, with the ambitions of the world .Their aim is to reduce their worldly engagements
                        to a minimum, more or less confined to such as are needed to maintain themselves and
                        their families in decency and to help the needy and the poor when occasion arises.
                        <br /><br /> &emsp;&emsp;The idea of erecting a magnificent and stupendous Samadh building
                        befitting
                        the memory of the August Founder of Radhasoami Faith, originated with Maharaj Saheb.
                        <br /><br /> &emsp;&emsp;Maharaj Saheb started dictating the English book "Discourses on
                        Radhasoami
                        Faith" in 1907. Mr. Cooper used to note down the dictation. Babuji Maharaj would touch
                        up and read it out to Maharaj Saheb. Due to Maharaj Saheb's indifferent health the dictation
                        of this book had to be stopped off and on, ultimately when His health broke down, He
                        altogether stopped dictating what had yet to be done on the book, as also revising the
                        already dictated material. After having dictated these basic principles Maharaj Saheb
                        stopped further dictating the book. The apparent reason was His failing health. The book
                        was later published by Babuji Maharaj. His discourses during Satsang are compiled in
                        the book 'Discourses of Maharaj Saheb'.
                        <br /><br /> &emsp;&emsp;Nearly a century ago Maharaj Saheb had in one of His discourses
                        predicted
                        that in future, Satsang would be telecast in such a manner that Satsangis all over the
                        world would be able to hear the discourses of the Sant Sat Guru and have His Darshan
                        at the touch of a button.
                        <br /><br /> &emsp;&emsp;After about one and a half year of initiation, Maharaj Saheb contracted
                        such a severe dysentery that He could not get up from His bed, nor could He eat anything.
                        His diet was reduced considerably. He even lost the urge to eat or drink anything. But this was
                        not due to illness
                        rather, it was what has been described in the following lines:-
                        <br />
                        &emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;
                        &emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;

                        <br />
                        &emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;
                        &emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;
                        &emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;<b>sleep and appetite begin to wane.</b>
                        <br /><br /> &emsp;&emsp;When Maharaj Saheb's end drew near,
                        Naiyanji had said, "Who will look after us? "Maharaj Saheb raising His hand skyward,
                        said thrice, "Radhasoami, Radhasoami, Radhasoami".
                        <br /><br /> &emsp;&emsp;Maharaj Saheb departed on Saturday, the 12th October 1907 in Soami
                        Bagh,
                        Benaras. The hall in Soami Bagh, Varanasi, where Satsang is held now-a-days, was under
                        construction in Maharaj Saheb's time, and the same was converted into His Samadh after
                        His departure.

                        &emsp;&emsp;Buaji Saheba was the elder sister of Maharaj Saheb. She was senior to Maharaj Saheb
                        by four years and functioned
                        as the fourth Sant Sat Guru of Radhasoami Faith. Her actual name was Maheshwari Devi.
                        Buaji Saheba's father's house and father-in-law's house were both located in the same
                        locality of Varanasi, called "Bari Piyari".

                        <br /><br /> &emsp;&emsp;Very shortly before His departure, Maharaj Saheb in one of His last
                        discourses
                        (public utterances) in open Satsang, declared in the presence of a large number of people
                        that the 'Nij Ansh' or a direct emanation from the Supreme Source endowed with full spiritual
                        powers, existed at the time in the body of a female and further exhorted that all should
                        direct their devotion to Her instead of trying to find a successor in one or other of
                        the Satsangis. He added that though She, owing to Her being in a female garb, would not
                        be able to discharge the functions in full, of an Acharya of the Mat, yet She would accord
                        internal assistance necessary for the spiritual advancement of Her devotees and also
                        give external assistance to some extent. In addition to above, Maharaj Saheb, about a
                        month before this declaration in Satsang, gave out in the presence of few Satsangis that
                        the Nij Ansh existed in His sister Buaji Saheba.
                        <br /><br /> &emsp;&emsp;In Her old age, Her health was failing day by day and She stayed behind
                        the curtain. It was for a very short time that She presided over Satsang. As such very
                        few people could derive benefit from Her Satsang. After Maharaj Saheb's departure, Buaji
                        Saheba did not agree to function openly for a pretty long time. Satsangis could go near
                        Her and derive benefit from Satsang only when Babuji Maharaj was there with Her. Some
                        Satsangis were exceptions to this rule. They could go and meet Buaji Saheba at any time.
                        <br /><br /> &emsp;&emsp;Maharaj Saheb often used to say that the next Sant Sat Guru would
                        effect
                        the weeding so that the true and pure Satsang would be left to a small size. After the
                        departure of Maharaj Saheb, the necessary weeding and purging happened in which many
                        people formed their own Guru at a different city and started their own Satsang.
                        <br /><br /> &emsp;&emsp;Buaji Saheba left Her mortal coil at 12.30 in the night between
                        Tuesday,
                        the 20

                        &emsp;&emsp;Babuji Maharaj was the fifth and the last manifest Sant Sat Guru of Radhasoami
                        Faith. Babuji Maharaj was the
                        last of the Nij Anshas who came in the time of Soamiji Maharaj. His life on earth coincided
                        practically with the growth of Radhasoami Satsang established in 1861, the year of his
                        birth. His association with the Satsang was the longest of all. So, with His departure
                        at the ripe age of 88, closed the biggest chapter in the history of Radhasoami Satsang.

                        <br /><br /> &emsp;&emsp;In the early hours of Wednesday, the 19
                        <sup>th</sup> June 1861, Babuji Maharaj was born as a grandson to the elder sister of Soamiji
                        Maharaj, at Varanasi (Benaras). Babuji Maharaj's name was Madhav Prasad Sinha but,
                        out of love and affection, he was called "Raja" (King). In January 1874 Soamiji Maharaj
                        initiated Babuji Maharaj in Radhasoami Faith. Huzur Maharaj gave Babuji Maharaj the Parmarthi
                        name of "Prem Adhar".
                        <br /><br /> &emsp;&emsp;Babuji Maharaj's mother was a great Parmarthi (pious) lady. She always
                        kept
                        Satsang and Parmarth (spiritual welfare) above all worldly pursuits. In the beginning of 1921,
                        Babuji Maharaj's mother passed away. She could neither
                        see nor hear. She was unmindful and oblivious of any physical injury or pain or even
                        bleeding. She remained in this state for quite some time. Often, she would say, "Look! Soamiji
                        Maharaj, Huzur Maharaj and Maharaj
                        Saheb have graced me by their arrival here." At times, she would call Babuji Maharaj
                        and say, "Raja! Should I be lying in bed like this in your presence?" Babuji Maharaj
                        would reply, "Bhabhi! Just remember what Soamiji Maharaj had told you that you have not
                        to be reborn in this world". Babuji Maharaj's father had a big jewellery shop in Kolkata
                        (Calcutta). In a short time, he earned so much that even the utensils of daily use were
                        of silver.
                        <br /><br /> &emsp;&emsp;Babuji Maharaj's father passed away on Saturday, the 1
                        <sup>st</sup> May 1875, at the age of 44, when Babuji Maharaj was only fourteen years. It
                        has been observed that parents of Sants, Sadhs and Mahatmas often die at a young age.
                        Huzur Maharaj's father died when Huzur Maharaj was only four years of age.
                        <br /><br /> &emsp;&emsp;Babuji Maharaj used to wear long hair during childhood. He was fond of
                        playing
                        upon musical instruments, specially sitar (a kind of guitar). He was very sharp in reading
                        and writing. In the beginning, He was not sent to any school. A tutor used to come to
                        his house to teach him Persian language, in which he was a muntahi (very proficient)
                        and was considered to be a good scholar of Persian even at the young age of 13 or 14
                        years. Once when Babuji Maharaj entered his class room on the first day, he felt a bit
                        perplexed and was thinking where he should sit, as all the seats were occupied, except
                        one by a robust boy. So robust and sturdy was he, that nobody dared sit near him. This
                        robust and sturdy boy was none other than Maharaj Saheb. As soon as their eyes met, Maharaj
                        Saheb instantly beckoned Babuji Maharaj to sit by his side and added that he should sit
                        with him daily. Maharaj Saheb greeted Babuji Maharaj like an old friend. From that day
                        on, both were seen together all the time. Both were drawn towards each other due to internal
                        attraction, as both had descended from Radhasoami Dham for the same benevolent purpose.
                        Two opposite forces were working upon Babuji Maharaj during his boyhood, the aforesaid
                        atmosphere of Kashi (Varanasi) and the influence of his uncle Sri Shiv Prasad on the
                        one hand and Soamiji Maharaj and His Satsang on the other. In 1884, he obtained the degree
                        of M. A. (Master of Arts) in English Literature from the premier University of Kolkata
                        (Calcutta), as a student of the Benares College.
                        <br /><br /> &emsp;&emsp;At the age of sixteen Babuji Maharaj was married to Srimati Bhagwan
                        Dei,
                        daughter of Sri Chiranji Lal Seth of Shikohabad (U.P). Huzur Maharaj gave her the parmarthi
                        name of Surat Pyari. She was generally called Maiyanji. Maiyanji means revered mother.
                        <br /><br /> &emsp;&emsp;Maharaj Saheb and Babuji Maharaj took their M. A. degree in 1884.
                        Thereafter,
                        they commenced the study of law, but soon discovered that a lawyer's profession would
                        not suit them as it requires constant exercise and diversion of mental faculties to mundane
                        affairs, which leave little time for meditation and for the care of the soul. Babuji
                        Maharaj was temperamentally very soft and obliging. He would not mind working for extra
                        hours, if necessary. His sole aim was efficiency. He worked as a Superintendent in the
                        budget section for a long time. Maharaj Saheb himself used to appreciate the ability
                        of Babuji Maharaj. The Accountant General often used to send difficult and complicated
                        cases for drafting and disposal to Babuji Maharaj. Being impressed with the ability and
                        gentle behaviour of Babuji Maharaj, the Accountant General recommended to the Government
                        for the conferment of the title of "Rai Saheb" on him, which was granted in 1914. Since
                        then be came to be known as Rai Saheb Madhav Prasad Sinha. In 1918, when Babuji Maharaj
                        proceeded on leave preparatory to retirement, the office staff was very much grieved.
                        Babuji Maharaj was pleased to observe that he had already written a long letter to the
                        Government of India for enhancing their salary and introduction of time scale of pay.
                        By Mauj, it was accepted.
                        <br /><br /> &emsp;&emsp;When Maharaj Saheb became Sant Sat Guru, Babuji Maharaj considered Him
                        to
                        be his Guru. He had totally forgotten that Maharaj Saheb was his friend and companion
                        of boyhood. He knew Him to be the Supreme Being personified, and loved Him as such. Babuji
                        Maharaj had always his eyes on the Charans (Feet) of Maharaj Saheb. He performed all
                        sorts of Sewa (service), high and low. He had, in fact, merged his entire existence in
                        Maharaj Saheb. If he purchased anything from the market for his personal use, as for
                        instance, apparel for wearing, he would first purchase it for Maharaj Saheb.
                        <br /><br /> &emsp;&emsp;Formerly, the members of a certain low caste were not allowed to enter
                        the
                        Samadh of Soamiji Maharaj. When Babuji Maharaj came to know of it, He ordered that no
                        one should be denied entry into the Samadh. Casteism should be kept away from here. All
                        should get an opportunity to pay homage at the Holy Samadh. From that day onwards, all
                        people are allowed free entry into the Samadh. There was a large collection of discourses,
                        which were noted down and reproduced from memory, after they had been delivered by Babuji
                        Maharaj in Satsang. Babuji Maharaj ordered their publication. The manuscript was sent
                        to the press on the 19
                        <sup>th</sup> August 1945, and by His grace, after complete one year, i.e. on the 19
                        <sup>th</sup> August 1946, which was the day of the annual Bhandara of Soamiji Maharaj, the
                        three volumes of Bachans or discourses were out. The fourth volume came out on the 16
                        <sup>th</sup> December 1946.
                        <br /><br /> &emsp;&emsp;Babuji Maharaj used to read the daily papers, magazines, etc. till the
                        end
                        of 1940. Gradually He stopped doing so, and asked His personal assistant to read out
                        the same to Him.Babuji Maharaj was lying in bed for six and a half years. He neither ate
                        anything nor sat or stood up. He could not change sides on the bed without help. All
                        that He took in 24 hours was just a little milk. A Satsangi had posed the question, "When
                        Saints do not have any Karams, why do they fall ill? It is true that they may not be
                        feeling any pain or restlessness or undergoing any suffering, yet to the outward appearance
                        it looks as if the body is suffering trouble and pain. What is their Mauj and purpose
                        behind all this?". Babuji Maharaj replied, "the Karams of the creation are reduced".
                        <br /><br /> &emsp;&emsp;Babuji Maharaj had no particular disease, except weakness due to old
                        age,
                        and cough, which increased or decreased with the change of season or weather conditions
                        and due to which sometimes temperature also rose. He could not get up from bed due to
                        weakness. In comparison to 1943, His condition was much better in later days. As regards
                        His daily food, it was meagre even during His youth. But during illness it was almost
                        nil. Still He listened carefully to the prayers of Satsangis. At 10 or 11 in the forenoon,
                        Satsang account books were daily read out to Him. Letters of Satsangis were read out
                        to Him and He used to give instructions regarding replies. He attended to the affairs
                        of Satsang and Satsangis, which were brought to His notice. Satsangis had several opportunities
                        during day and night to have His darshan. Out station Satsangis also visited Soami Bagh
                        more often than before for having the maximum benefit of darshan and Satsang during the
                        last days of Babuji Maharaj when He also, in His august Mauj, had opened the doors of
                        unbounded grace and mercy. Babuji Maharaj remained, for the most part, in a state of
                        concentration and withdrawal. He would bring down the spirit current for a little while
                        and that too in a very small measure.
                        <br /><br /> &emsp;&emsp;Babuji Maharaj was continually enhancing the flow of His ambrosial
                        grace
                        and mercy as the time of His departure to Original Abode was drawing nearer and nearer.
                        This flow of grace and mercy was there for ever but its form was different at different
                        times. To any request or prayer made to Him, He would always say, 'yes'. He agreed to
                        whatever was pleaded before Him. After His departure, the first Bhandara of Babuji Maharaj
                        was held on Sunday the 23
                        <sup>rd</sup> October 1949 in Soami Bagh, Agra. Babuji Maharaj's ashes have been enshrined
                        in the Cremation Memorial in Radha Bagh, and also kept in His room in Soami Bagh. At
                        both these places Satsangis pay obeisance.

                        &emsp;&emsp;In the Radhasoami Faith, great is the importance of the Sant Sat Guru of the time.
                        <br />&emsp;&emsp;“When the Sat Guru of the time departs, He appoints someone as His successor
                        in
                        whom He re-incarnates and thus continues the work of regeneration of Jivas as
                        before……….Therefore,
                        an earnest devotee should make no distinction between the previous Sat Guru and His successor.
                        But
                        those who are bigoted devotees will not come under the allegiance to the succeeding Sat Guru.
                        For this reason, their progress will also stop at the stage they had reached during the time of
                        the
                        former Sat Guru and there would be no further progress and improvement”.
                        (Sar Bachan Radhasoami, Prose, Part-2, Bachan-250)
                        <br />&emsp;&emsp;The Sant Sat Guru of the time while present on this plane, may choose not to
                        ‘manifest’
                        immediately. When the Sant Sat Guru of the time is not manifested, there is a period of
                        Interregnum, so to say.
                        Interregnum does not mean that He is not present. He is indeed present but during Interregnum He
                        does not grant
                        His recognition, therefore people do not know His identity. When it is His Mauj, He grants
                        recognition to
                        Adhikari (fit) Jivas. Gradually others also become aware and associate themselves with Him.
                        Indeed, it would not be right to say that there has been no Sant Sat Guru all these years in
                        Radhasoami
                        Satsang, Soamibagh, Agra. The Sant Sat Guru has been present all this time, and He is very much
                        present.
                        He Himself gives His own recognition at the proper time. Those who regularly and daily perform
                        spiritual
                        practices (Sumiran, Dhyan, and Bhajan) do come to know about it internally in the fullness of
                        time.
                        Reliable proof or indication can be had only in the course of performing internal practices.
                        “Till one receives an unmistakable proof within oneself of the manifestation of the Sant Sat
                        Guru, one
                        had better continue to stick to the form of the last Sant Sat Guru.
                        There is no time limit for such a manifestation. It all depends upon His Mauj or the Divine
                        Will.
                        But there should not be any doubt in one’s mind that the divine current is or will ever be
                        withdrawn
                        from this plane, till the redemption of the entire creation has been affected. Hence, having
                        full
                        faith and belief in the words of the Sant Sat Gurus, one should go on applying oneself to
                        Parmarthi
                        pursuits, viz., Sumiran, Dhyan, Bhajan, reading, studying and cogitating upon the holy
                        literature and
                        exchanging views regarding matters of the Faith among brother Satsangis and devotees.” (Holy
                        Epistles, Part-4, Letter-20)
                        If we increase our fitness by following the instructions for making spiritual endeavours:
                        “Satguru Himself would come to meet such a Parmárthi” (Sar Bachan Radhasoami, Poetry,
                        Part-1,Bachan-13, Shabd-1, Couplet -13)
                        <br />&emsp;&emsp;In the absence of a manifest Sant Sat Guru, Huzur Maharaj has indicated the
                        course of
                        action for sincere devotees in Prem Patra, Part 2, Bachan 11. Some extracts from it are given
                        below:
                        “According to the teachings of Sants, the Jiva must attend Satsang once or twice every day till
                        his delusions
                        are somewhat removed. It is a great boon if he luckily gets to Satsang of Sant Sat Guru or Sadh.
                        Otherwise,
                        he should read and study, carefully and attentively, the scriptures of Sants, once or twice
                        daily. Even
                        this would be very beneficial and his ignorance and misunderstanding would be gradually removed,
                        Whenever
                        he can conveniently do so, he should make it a point to visit the head-quarters Satsang at Soami
                        Bagh once
                        or twice a year, or once in two or three years, and stay there for at least a week or two or for
                        a longer
                        duration. He should utilize this opportunity for removing his doubts and misunderstandings and
                        also the
                        impediments and obstacles which hamper his Abhyas (devotional practices). “
                        “Even attendance at the Satsang is not possible without grace and mercy. Radhasoami Dayal, in
                        His grace,
                        fulfils the desire of sincere Parmarthis as and when He considers it proper. Now and then, He
                        creates circumstances
                        favourable for the ardent Parmarthis to attend Satsang and derive benefit therefrom. If no such
                        opportunity
                        is available by Mauj, they are brought in contact with some high class Satsangi from whom they
                        hear spiritual
                        discourses so that they may also begin to progress on the path of salvation. It, however,
                        behoves all Parmarthis
                        to engender an intense longing for visiting Satsang, and to do all they can to achieve this.”

                        &emsp;&emsp;Soamiji Maharaj had His residence in the city. On account of charities and
                        alms-giving, His house was all the
                        time surrounded by beggars and mendicants whose number went on increasing. This caused much
                        inconvenience and disturbance in Satang. Therefore, He decided to shift to some place outside
                        the city. He stayed in several bungalows and houses in the outskirts but did not have the
                        Mauj of a sojourn for more than 8-10 days in any one of them, as none of them was to His
                        liking. Then He started moving out of the city at some distance away on Sukhpal (palanquin)
                        which the Sadhus and Satsangis used to carry on their shoulders and visited various sites
                        in the vicinity of the city of Agra. Finally, He approved a site, about three miles north
                        of the city. There, He laid the foundation of a Bagh (garden) called Radhasoami Bagh or Soami
                        Bagh.

                        <br /><br />&emsp;&emsp;At this site there was a piece of elevated land in the centre. Soamiji
                        Maharaj
                        took His seat there. He ordered the water of the well, already existing there, to be fetched
                        for Him. On tasting it, He called aloud to Huzur Maharaj by His name and observed that it
                        was really good water. Soamiji Maharaj had sanctified the water of this well. The main portion
                        of Soami Bagh land was taken in the name of Soamiji Maharaj on November 9, 1876 at a lease
                        rent of Rs.12/- per year. Later the entire land of 5 Bighas, 16 Biswas including the well
                        (approx 14,500 sq.mts) was purchased at a cost of Rs.200/-.
                        <br /><br /> &emsp;&emsp;One morning, Soamiji Maharaj was taking a walk in the garden with three
                        or four
                        Sadhus. One of the Sadhus, named Chetan Das, pointed towards a piece of elevated land in
                        the centre, and said that a Kothi (house, mansion) should be built there for Soamiji Maharaj,
                        for which it was very suitable. Soamiji Maharaj observed that a Guru Dwara would stand there.
                        All kept quiet. Nobody could understand the significance of the words.
                        <br /><br /> &emsp;&emsp;The entire Soami Bagh is a sanctuary for Satsangis because Soamiji
                        Maharaj,
                        Huzur Maharaj, Maharaj Saheb and Babuji Maharaj walked here. It is for this reason that once
                        Babuji Maharaj was pleased to observe thus - How excellent is the water of this well (in
                        Soami Bagh). It is as healthy as Ghee (clarified butter). Children playing, sporting,
                        frolicking,
                        walking, racing etc. in this garden (Soami Bagh) is as good as performing Abhyas or the
                        devotional
                        practices.

                        &emsp;&emsp;Holy Samadh is located in the premises of Soami Bagh, Agra. The construction of
                        Samadh started in 1904 and continued till 1907. It was temporarily suspended from 1907 to 1923.
                        Since 1923, the construction is going on uninterruptedly and the main dome has been completed in
                        2018. The total height of the whole structure is 193 feet. The four minarets are 104 feet high
                        over the plinth of the main structure.

                        <br /><br />&emsp;&emsp;The soil in Soami Bagh is sandy and foundations laid on it could not be
                        expected to support the weight of such a massive structure. Hence, it was considered necessary
                        to sink 52 wells to be connected with arches on which to build its walls. The wells are of
                        different sizes, their diameters varying according to the requirements of the main structure in
                        different places, from 5.5 feet to 10.5 feet and depths from 40 feet to 45 feet so as to reach
                        the layer of hard soil, technically called ‘Mota’, in each case. The masonry of the foundation
                        wells consists of bricks and lime. The wells have been filled with brick, concrete and lime. On
                        the top of each well is constructed a base consisting of huge blocks of stones of 6 sq.ft and
                        2.5 feet thick in two layers. Over the bases, arches of stones 2.5 feet thick, in two cross
                        layers, have been constructed and the wells thus connected with one another.
                        <br /><br />&emsp;&emsp;The main structure consists of a hall, 68 feet by 68 feet surrounded by
                        verandahs 15 feet wide on all sides. The width of the walls is 3 feet. The main structure is 110
                        sq.ft. There is a 55 feet broad platform round it, thus making the whole structure 220 sq.ft.
                        The platform is 15.5 feet above the ground level. In the platform, there are 52 rooms, 13 on
                        each side. The rooms are 10 feet broad but of different lengths. They have been provided with a
                        verandah 8 feet broad. In front of this verandah, all around there is again a platform 10 feet
                        broad with 4 steps all round leading to a 20 feet broad canal having water 5 feet deep. Beyond
                        this canal there will be a road 20 feet wide paved with red sand stone. The floor of the main
                        hall will be exactly 20 feet high above the level of the red sand-stone road. On each of the
                        four corners of the verandahs there is a Burj (pinnacle). In the south west corner, the Burj
                        will meet ‘Bhajan Ghar’, and the platform in front of the verandah of the rooms in the plinth
                        will merge in ‘Bhajan Ghar’ and so also the canal. In order that Bhajan Ghar may remain intact,
                        it is proposed to let the water of the canal flow to its south and west.
                        <br /><br />&emsp;&emsp;The sacred well in the garden is considered to be an important relic. It
                        is exactly on the north of the flight of stairs leading to the main entrance from the outer edge
                        of the canal. Another well on the south of the steps has also been made to preserve the
                        symmetry. The first storey of the verandahs is 21.25 feet high and has a gallery 4 feet 7 inches
                        wide jutting into the main hall. This may be especially useful for accommodating ladies at the
                        time of congregational services. The height of the second storey of the verandahs is 20.25 feet
                        at which level the height of the main hall reaches 41.4 feet. At a further height of 14 feet by
                        means of corbelling series of semi-circular arch rings one over the other, octagonal plinth of
                        the dome is formed on the outer side. To form a circular ring above the plinth, masonry in
                        cement on the inside of a total height of 13.25 feet is projected. It is decorated with hill
                        scenery. Here the diameter of the dome is 54.5 feet. The outside of the hill scenery forms the
                        neck of the dome. The second gallery for visitors to go and see the dome work and also for
                        labourers for cleaning etc. has been provided 6.75 feet above the hill scenery on projecting
                        masonry. There is a colonnade of round pillars 11.25 feet high above the foot of the gallery all
                        round it, as though it forms the neck of the inside arch of the dome. On the outside, the base
                        of the dome over the neck is 14.75 feet and the lower outer segment of the dome which is 39 feet
                        high over the basement proper is 11 feet thick of brick in cement in 3 rings with 3 inches thick
                        marble panels on the outside and over this ring rises the cap of the dome 91 feet above the
                        lower semicircular arch. Above this cap there will be a golden copper Kalash 32 feet high. Thus,
                        the The verandah pillars are octagonal in shape. They are marble monoliths 6 feet, 5 inches high
                        and 21 feet in diameter, supported on a carved base 11 feet thick of marble 31 sq.ft and covered
                        with elaborately carved caps 21 feet thick of marble 31 sq.ft. To add to the beauty of the
                        elevation on the north and south, 8 round pillars on each side have been provided on projecting
                        masonry. To give a clear idea of what the structure would be like and for the future guidance of
                        engineers, architects, artists, workers. etc., a miniature model has been prepared. It was
                        completed in June 1928.The scale of the model is 21 feet equal to 1 inch.

                        <br /><br />&emsp;&emsp;A look at the model of the building, together with the details given
                        above, and the exquisite beauty of the relief carving in marble and the inlaid stone work done
                        so far, would give some idea of the grandeur of the building, as it will stand when completed.
                        Even as it is, the Samadh and its miniature model are visited by thousands of tourists every
                        day. The building has an oriental setting, but different styles of architecture have been
                        beautifully blended to denote the catholicity of the Radhasoami religion, which has, among its
                        members, peoples of different nationalities. For the same reason, monograms have been provided
                        in different characters, viz. Hindi, Persian and English. In a building of this kind it is
                        natural that construction should go slow, principally due to the elaborate and exquisite marble
                        carving and variegated and exuberant ornamentation, which are the special features of this
                        building. Such work, involving intricate details, cannot be done expeditiously. A single large
                        marble slab, with its skilled carvings of fruit trees, flowers and foliage, takes years to
                        complete it.
                        <br /><br />&emsp;&emsp;Ceilings of the verandahs have been constructed with marble slabs 4
                        inches, 5 inches and 6 inches thick and about 2 sq.ft fitted into one another, without the
                        support of steel or any other girders. The ceiling is certainly a remarkable feat of engineering
                        skill and design. Entire expenditure on the construction of the building is met from spontaneous
                        and voluntary Bhents or offerings by Satsangis, under the administration of the Central
                        Administrative Council, Soami Bagh, Agra.
                        <br /><br />&emsp;&emsp;Five or six months after the departure of Soamiji Maharaj, Huzur Maharaj
                        started construction of the Samadh of Soamiji Maharaj on this very spot (of elevated land),
                        which was completed in 1879. This Samadh was very small and simple and was built of red
                        sandstone. When His Samadh was constructed at that spot, it became clear that by Guru Dwara,
                        Soamiji Maharaj had meant His Samadh. Regarding the construction of Holy Samadh of Soamiji
                        Maharaj, Huzur Maharaj was pleased to observe that - "It is very essential and proper that a
                        suitable building be constructed in memory of the
                        August Founder of the Radhasoami Faith and Revealer of Surat Shabd Yoga. This will enable
                        the Satsangis of all the countries to assemble at the headquarters of the Faith where Radhasoami
                        Dayal manifested Himself in the human form. They would meet there at some appointed time.
                        Observing their love and devotion and spiritual progress, they would derive mutual advantage.
                        There, they may also explain and understand the principles of the Radhasoami Faith. Thus,
                        they would strengthen the bond of Love and fellow feeling by cautiously giving out their
                        spiritual experiences. This will augment their love and faith, mutual affection and spiritual
                        unity. In this way, they would all help in the propagation of their unique religion and its
                        easy and unparalleled spiritual practice. For this purpose, there can be no other suitable
                        place than the Radhasoami Bagh (Soami Bagh), where Radhasoami Dayal Himself stayed for some
                        time, where His Holy Samadh has been erected and where His photo and other holy relics have
                        been preserved".
                        <br /><br />&emsp;&emsp;When Huzur Maharaj was Post Master General, He used to go off and on to
                        various states for opening new post offices. The Maharaja of Gwalior State gladly made a present
                        of Rs. 10,000/- to Him which He initially refused, but later accepted after approval from the
                        Government. The above sum was spent on the construction of Soamiji Maharaj's holy Samadh and the
                        boundary walls of Soami Bagh.
                        <br /><br />&emsp;&emsp;In 1904, for the first time, in His Mauj, Maharaj Saheb conveyed that a
                        magnificent building be constructed. "Just as Radhasoami Faith is a unique Faith to illuminate
                        the entire world with the brightness
                        of its spirituality, where people of all nationalities, all religions are included and can
                        join; the Samadh of Param Purush Puran Dhani Soamiji Maharaj, the first Sant Sat Guru who
                        revealed the Radhasoami Faith, should similarly have a beautiful amalgam of the diverse and
                        varied styles and forms of architecture from all races and nations". Thus, the idea of erecting
                        a magnificent and stupendous Samadh building befitting the memory of the August Founder of
                        Radhasoami Faith, first occurred to Maharaj Saheb, the third Sant Sat Guru of the Faith.
                        Accordingly, the foundation was laid by Him in 1904. The date of foundation laying was Baisakh
                        Shukl Panchmi, Wednesday, Samvat 1961 Vikram, corresponding to 20<sup>th</sup> April 1904.
                        <br /><br />&emsp;&emsp;Babuji Maharaj appointed Lala Tota Ram as the Supervising Engineer,
                        Samadh Works, Soami Bagh. Agra. Lala Tota Ram joined on 1<sup>st</sup> December 1907. The
                        present hall of the Samadh was constructed in 1925 using the same foundation that was laid in
                        1904 for the Samadh of Soamiji Maharaj. While delivering a discourse on August 23, 1937 in the
                        open Satsang held in the Samadh hall, Babuji Maharaj was graciously pleased to pronounce - "If
                        replica of Sat Lok is there on the surface of earth anywhere, it is here, it is here,
                        it is here.
                        "Saying or thinking that the Samadh is also a temple is not proper. It is also not proper to
                        think that one will obtain salvation through Samadhs. The ashes of the past Sants have been kept
                        in Samadhs and doing this is an indication of
                        the regard and reverence towards them. Samadhs are constructed at the places where the Sant
                        Sat Gurus presided and held Satsang. By visiting and paying obeisance, a transformation takes
                        place in the mind, such that it gets inclined towards Parmarth. Therefore, visiting the Samadhs,
                        paying obeisance and performing Satsang there is in practice and is considered proper ".
                        <br /><br />&emsp;&emsp;There is a spiritual significance to the measure of '68' in the 68 sq.ft
                        main hall. There are said to be 68 places of pilgrimage. Hence by visiting Holy Samadh of
                        Soamiji Maharaj, one will earn as much spiritual sanctity or derive as much spiritual benefit,
                        as one does by visiting 68 pilgrimage sites, of course in the mood of sincere devotion.

                        &emsp;&emsp;Bhajan Ghar is located in the premises of Soami Bagh, Agra. Soamiji Maharaj visited
                        Soami Bagh daily and returned
                        in the evening. He used to perform Bhajan, take His meal, hold Satsang and distribute
                        Prashad here. There was no room or house at this place at that time. There were thatched
                        sheds only. Under one of such sheds, Soamiji Maharaj used to perform Bhajan, which is
                        now known as Bhajan Ghar (House of Devotion).
                        <br /><br />&emsp;&emsp;It is a place of special importance for performing spiritual practices.
                        The devotee experiences greater bliss and his Surat ascends with some ease during Bhajan
                        in Bhajan Ghar. It has been said by Babuji Maharaj that those who perform devotional
                        practices in Bhajan Ghar, will get added grace and mercy of the Supreme father, Radhasoami
                        Dayal. They will experience greater facility and ease in the proper performance of devotional
                        exercises. It is so because Soamiji Maharaj performed Abhyas in Bhajan Ghar.

                        &emsp;&emsp;Kothi of Babuji Maharaj is located in the premises of Soami Bagh, Agra. Babuji
                        Maharaj lived in a rented house in Atarsooiya, Allahabad. A little further away, lived Maharaj
                        Saheb. For about 40 years, Satsang was held in this lane. The number of Satsangis was increasing
                        day by day. On the occasions of holidays and festivals, there used to be such a great rush that
                        many people could neither get Darshan nor hear discourses properly. For office work, the space
                        was not adequate. For lodging out station Satsangis, buildings were rented. Thus, hundreds of
                        rupees were spent on rent every month. Ultimately, Babuji Maharaj decided to shift the Satsang
                        headquarters from Allahabad to Soami Bagh, Agra. There were many requests and supplications from
                        the Satsangis of Allahabad against this. Babuji Maharaj said that Huzur Maharaj had ordered Him
                        to pass the last days of His life in Soami Bagh, Agra.
                        <br /><br />&emsp;&emsp;The Kothi (house) of Babuji Maharaj had been constructed in Soami Bagh
                        in 1922 itself. Babuji Maharaj arrived permanently in His Kothi at 7:30 PM on November 29, 1937.
                        Babuji Maharaj's Kothi was His place of residence. It was here that Babuji Maharaj held Satsang
                        and it was here that He left His mortal coil and departed to His Nij Dham. After the departure
                        of Babuji Maharaj, four Satsangs are regularly held every day in Soami Bagh, of which two
                        Satsangs, (one in the morning and one in the evening), are held at Babuji Maharaj's Kothi.

                        Samadh built of red sand
                        stone constructed by Huzur Maharaj was demolished in 1904, its stones and other materials
                        were used in the construction of the Samadh of Radhaji Maharaj in Radha Bagh, where some
                        portion of Her ashes has also been enshrined. The rest of Her ashes are with those of
                        Soamiji Maharaj in the Samadh of Soamiji Maharaj in Soami Bagh, Agra. In Soamiji Maharaj's
                        time, there was only a raised earth mound in Radha Bagh. When in Radha Bagh, Soamiji
                        Maharaj used to sit on it and at times, perform Bhajan too.
                        <br /><br />&emsp;&emsp;After Soamiji Maharaj's departure to His Original Abode, a platform and
                        a room were built on this mound. In this act of Sewa, along with other Satsangis, Maharaj
                        Saheb and Babuji Maharaj also took part, that is, they also carried basketfuls of earth
                        dug up for the construction. The palanquin used by Soamiji Maharaj is also kept here.
                        Once, on a specific occasion, Bahuji Maharaj had observed that "Radha Bagh is not a picnic
                        spot, rather it would be a place of worship". When Babuji Maharaj left His mortal coil,
                        His last rites were conducted in Radha Bagh itself and subsequently His Samadh was also
                        constructed in Radha Bagh. Since then, till today, evening Satsang on the 20
                        <sup>th</sup> of every month is held in the Samadh of Babuji Maharaj at Radha Bagh, instead
                        of His Kothi in Soami Bagh.

                        &emsp;&emsp;Panni Gali is a lane situated in Agra city, 6.5 kms from Soami Bagh. In this lane is
                        a residence which is the place of birth and departure to eternal abode of Param Purush Puran
                        Dhani Soamiji Maharaj and this is the place where He resided. Here, there is a small room within
                        another room. This place has a special significance.

                        &emsp;&emsp;It is said that during the period of Soamiji Maharaj, Panni Gali was in a very bad
                        condition. At some places, there were pitfalls, at others there were slopes or inclines. The
                        stinking water from the lavatories used to flow here, there and everywhere in the lane. There
                        was always the danger of slipping and breaking one's limbs. The residential house of Soamiji
                        Maharaj was also of kachcha bricks (made of unbaked bricks and mud) and small. In fact, Panni
                        Gali, where Soamiji Maharaj assumed bodily form, established and held Satsang for years, was a
                        place fit only for ardent lovers and true devotees like Huzur Maharaj who were totally oblivious
                        of pitfalls and dirty drains in the lane. Babuji Maharaj was once pleased to declare that Panni
                        Gali is really Prem Gali, that is, the lane of love.
                        <br /><br />&emsp;&emsp;The old residential house of Soamiji Maharaj was demolished and
                        reconstructed under the supervision of the late Sri Tota Ram, the Supervising Engineer of the
                        Radhasoami Samadh Works. Babuji Maharaj had instructed Sri Tota Ram in the following words: "As
                        Soamiji Maharaj was born and had resided and held His Satsang in this house for 60 years,
                        every particle of it has been highly spiritualised. Every brick of this house is saturated
                        with Shabd and Sound Current. Hence, not a single piece out of the broken fragments of this
                        sacred house should be thrown away. Bricks, brick-bats, mortar and earth of this house should
                        be used during the course of construction of this house along with new material ". The new house
                        was completed in July 1916, much before the celebration of the first birth centenary of Soamiji
                        Maharaj in 1918.

                        &emsp;&emsp;Pipal Mandi is an area situated in Agra city, 6.5 kms from Soami Bagh. This was the
                        residence of Huzur
                        Maharaj. The place where His house with a big gate now exists, had a high mound and open
                        land. Huzur Maharaj purchased this land and built a splendid mansion on it with seven
                        courtyards. This house is known as Huzuri Bhawan. Its construction was complete when
                        Huzur Maharaj came over from Allahabad after retirement.
                        <br /><br />&emsp;&emsp;Two houses adjacent to each other were purchased in front of Huzuri
                        Bhawan
                        in March 1893 for accommodating outstation Satsangis. They are known as "Prem Niwas".
                        There are four or five courtyards and about forty big and small rooms. Another house
                        just adjacent to Huzuri Bhawan in the north, formerly Mufid-i-am-School, was purchased
                        in June 1896. This is Prem Bilas. When alterations, additions and repairs had been carried
                        out, Huzur Maharaj left his residential house and shifted to Prem Bilas. He would go
                        to His residential house occasionally, but sometime before His departure, he permanently
                        resided in Prem Bilas. Prem Bilas means bliss of love. A lot of spiritual pleasure and
                        enjoyment of Sant's company, discourses, Artis (ceremonial functions of prayer) Bhog
                        and Bhandara feasts took place here.

                        &emsp;&emsp;As in Soami Bagh, Agra, Soamiji Maharaj had pointed towards a mound, on which His
                        Samadh is presently being built, and had observed that a Gurudwara would stand there, so also
                        when the hall (Satsang-hall) was under construction in Soami Bagh, Varanasi, Maharaj Saheb had
                        observed that He would hold Satsang there. The hall in Soami Bagh, Varanasi, where Satsang is
                        held now-a-days, was under construction in Maharaj Saheb's time and the same was converted into
                        His Samadh after His departure.
                        <br /><br />&emsp;&emsp;On the north of the hall there is a platform like a stage, in the centre
                        of which lies the Samadh of Maharaj Saheb, with sufficient space provided on either side for
                        ladies to sit during Satsang (congregation). The balconies on the three sides of the hall facing
                        the Samadh are also meant for ladies to sit during congregation. The iron gate of Soami Bagh was
                        fabricated in Calcutta (now Kolkata). When the gate was being fixed up, the Maharaja (ruler) of
                        Varanasi happened to pass that way in his horse driven carriage. Amazed to see such a big gate,
                        he remarked that it was unbelievable that a gate bigger than that of his own palace existed in
                        his State! When he was told that it was the Guru-Darbar (Guru's court), he bowed his head in
                        reverence. It is said that even today when the ruler of Kashi and his heirs pass that way, they
                        bow their heads down in reverence before Soami Bagh.
